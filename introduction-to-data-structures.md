# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms form the foundation of computer science and software development. Understanding them is crucial for writing efficient code and solving complex problems.

## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size sequential collection of elements
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic collection of nodes connected by pointers
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) structure
- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structure with nodes
- **Graphs**: Collection of nodes connected by edges

## What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing computations. Key algorithm categories include:

- **Sorting**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort
- **Searching**: Linear search, binary search
- **Graph algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm
- **Dynamic programming**: Breaking problems into subproblems

## Why Learn DSA?

1. **Better problem-solving skills**
2. **Write more efficient code**
3. **Ace technical interviews**
4. **Build scalable applications**
